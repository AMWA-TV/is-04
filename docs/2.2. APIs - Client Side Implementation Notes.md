# APIs: Client Side Implementation Notes

## mDNS Bridging

For clients which need to discover the services of a Query API, but operate in software such as web browsers where mDNS is unsupported, it is suggested that a bridging service is employed to present the mDNS (and merged unicast DNS) data via an HTTP service (or similar).

## Failure Modes

The NMOS Registration and Query APIs are designed to be highly available and support failover without any visible consequence for a user operating a system which depends upon them. Recommended handling of common error codes and scenarios is covered in [Behaviour](4.0. Behaviour.md).
