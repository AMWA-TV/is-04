# Upgrade Path

As is common with web APIs, over time changes will be made to support new use cases and deprecate old ways of working. The NMOS APIs are no different, and have been designed to permit in-service upgrades across a facility which may be running large amounts of equipment with support for different versions of these specifications.

API versioning is specified in the [APIs](2.0. APIs.md) documentation, with procedures for handling upgrades described below.

## Requirements for Nodes (Node APIs)

Implementers of the Node API must support at least one API version, and may support more than one at a time. Note however that a Node must only perform interactions with a Registration API at a single version. Nodes implementing multiple API versions may provide a user-configurable choice for which API version to register using.

Registrations with a Registration API must only proceed if the Node API version implemented exactly matches the API version used by the Registration API.

## Requirements for Registries (Registration and Query APIs)

Implementers of the Registration and Query API must support at least one API version. It is however strongly recommended that Registration and Query APIs fully support at least two and preferably more consecutive API versions (if released). In doing so, facilities which include a large number of Nodes may stagger their equipment upgrades whilst maintaining compatibility with a single registry.

When supporting multiple API versions, Registration and Query APIs must provide translations between resource representations which are registered against different versions of the API. For example, if a v1.0 resource registration is made and returned via a v1.1 Query API, the API must add any missing keys and values to that response to make it v1.1 compliant. Conversely if a v1.1 registration is made and returned via a v1.0 Query API, keys which would not have been valid at v1.0 must be removed from the response.

In cases where missing data between API versions cannot be inferred, the values may be returned as 'null', or an empty array dependent on the data type. Note that for critical keys this may not be sufficient to ensure a functional system. As a result it is not advised to support large jumps between supported API versions. Upgrades to these specifications will ensure a guaranteed upgrade path between at least adjacent API versions.
