## Receiver Subscriptions

This method is deprecated, but SHOULD be supported alongside any other connection mechanisms up to and including v1.2. From v1.3 Nodes MAY choose to return a 501 response from this endpoint as opposed to implementing it.

Please see the NMOS Connection API specification for the current methods for creating connections between Senders and Receivers.

A PUT request to `/receivers/{receiverId}/target` of the Node API will modify which Sender a Receiver is subscribed to.

In order to 'subscribe' a Receiver to a Sender, a PUT request should be made to this resource containing a full Sender object.
In order to 'unsubscribe' a Receiver from a Sender, an empty object '{}' should be used in this PUT request.
In both cases the target resource should respond with a 202 code (accepted) on success, and a response body matching the request body.

The Receiver's subscription object contains a 'sender_id' attribute which must be updated once a Receiver has successfully requested, parsed and actioned a change to the manifest_href is it connected to.
