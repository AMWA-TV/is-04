## API Resources

Where the behaviour associated with an API attribute is not sufficiently clear from its name and schema constraints, this is documented below.

### Senders

`subscription`: The 'subscription' key is used to indicate how a Sender currently connects to Receivers in a networked media system. The subscription MUST be updated to reflect the current configuration of the Sender whether it was modified via an NMOS mechanism or an externally-defined control mechanism.

`subscription` `active`: The 'active' key MUST be set to 'true' when the Sender is configured to enable transmission of packets to the network, whether via a push- or pull-based mechanism. The key MUST be set to 'false' when the Sender is configured to disable transmission of packets to the network.

`subscription` `receiver_id`: The 'receiver_id' key MUST be set to `null` in all cases except where a unicast push-based Sender is configured to transmit to an NMOS Receiver, and the 'active' key is set to 'true'. When not set to `null`, the 'receiver_id' MUST be set to the UUID of an NMOS Receiver.

### Receivers

`subscription`: The 'subscription' key is used to indicate how a Receiver currently connects to Senders in a networked media system. The subscription MUST be updated to reflect the current configuration of the Receiver whether it was modified via an NMOS mechanism or an externally-defined control mechanism.

`subscription` `active`: The 'active' key MUST be set to 'true' when the Receiver is configured to enable reception of packets from the network. The key MUST be set to 'false' when the Receiver is configured to disable reception of packets from the network.

`subscription` `sender_id`: The 'sender_id' key MUST be set to `null` in all cases except where the Receiver is currently configured to receive from an NMOS Sender, and the 'active' key is set to 'true'. When not set to `null`, the 'sender_id' MUST be set to the UUID of an NMOS Sender.
